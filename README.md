# Voter-Database
A program that simulates voting in an election.
The database contains three voters with voter ID's 1,2 and 3. Use these ID's to login into the program.

This Java program depends on a sqlite library labeled "sqlite-jdbc-3.40.0.0" which can be found within the repository.
The private static final String DB_URL was also be modified to reference the file "univ.db" on your local disk.
